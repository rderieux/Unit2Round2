Unit 2 - Block 13 19:00

A **statement** is a combination of _expressions_ to communicate 1 full idea.

**Conditional statement**
This allows our code to do different things depending on some condition.

In code, a condition is represented by a **boolean expression**
A boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to a single boolean.

A **comparison operator** compares the two operands and evaluates to a boolean.

6 comparison operators: >, >=, <, <=, ===, !==

A **logical operator** expects booleans as operands

AND && true when both operands are true
OR || true when at least one operand is true, otherwise false
NOT ! flips the value of its operand

**Functions** is a _named_ sequence of instructions for the computer to follow.
Nothing happens _until_ the computer follows the instructions.  
That act is called invoking/calling the function.

Functions declared with the _function_ keyword are **hoisted**.
That means their definitions are always, by default, pulled up to the top.

A function underneath the hood is just a variable:
a name that points to a memory address, at which data is stored.
The data is a bunch of binary, with type function, meant to be read as
instructions for the computer to follow.

An **arrow function** is an **anonymous function**, usually assigned directly to a variable.

A _function_ is a set of instructions that produces some output when given some input.

The computer cares about the _type_ of data going in & out.
Given some input, a function should always return the same output.

A functions **parameters** define the input variables.
We can pass **arguments** into the function as input when we call the function.

A function **returns** some value as its output.
