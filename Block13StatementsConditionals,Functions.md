Unit 2 - Block 13 19:00

A **statement** is a combination of expressions to communicate 1 full idea.

**Conditional statement**
This allows our code to do different things depending on some condition.

In code, a condition is represented by a **boolean expression**
A boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to a single boolean.

A **comparison operator** compares the two operands and evaluates to a boolean

6 comparison operators: >, >=, <, <=, ===, !==

A **logical operator** expects booleans as operands

AND && true when both operands are true
OR || true when at least one operand is true, otherwise false
NOT ! flips the value of its operand
